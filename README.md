# Stopwatch by ItsMe Prince

A sleek and efficient stopwatch application built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This project showcases my ability to create functional, responsive web applications with a focus on performance and user experience.

## Features

- **Start, Stop, and Reset Functionality**: Effortlessly control the stopwatch with buttons for starting, stopping, and resetting the timer.
- **Responsive Design**: The stopwatch adjusts beautifully across various screen sizes, offering a smooth experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Accurate Time Tracking**: Displays the elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds with precision.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building fast, server-side rendered web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that enables quick design customization and responsive layouts.

## Installation

1. Install Dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Run the Development Server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Your stopwatch application will be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

1. Open the Application: Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
2. Control the Stopwatch: Use the buttons to start, stop, and reset the timer.
3. View the Time: The current elapsed time will be displayed in real-time.

## Customization

The stopwatch's design and behavior can be easily customized by editing the Tailwind CSS styles or adjusting the timing logic in the Next.js components.
